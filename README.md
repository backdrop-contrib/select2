Select2
=======

Select2 is a jQuery (1.8.2+) based replacement for select boxes. It supports
searching, remote data sets, and infinite scrolling of results. This module
allows for integration of Select2 into Backdrop CMS.

* jQuery - http://jquery.com/
* Select2 - http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/

Features:

* Enhancing native selects with search.
* Enhancing native selects with a better multi-select interface.
* Loading data from JavaScript: easily load items via ajax and have them
  searchable.
* Nesting optgroups: native selects only support one level of nested. Select2
  does not have this restriction.
* Tagging: ability to add new items on the fly.
* Working with large, remote datasets: ability to partially load a dataset
  based on the search term.
* Paging of large datasets: easy support for loading more pages when the
  results are scrolled to the end.
* Templating: support for custom rendering of results and selections.
