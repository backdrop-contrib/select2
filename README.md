# Select2

Integrates Backdrop autocomplete and select fields with the **Select2** jQuery library.

Note: There is a core [feature request to integrate Select2 in core](https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/3069).

Features:

* Enhancing native selects with search.
* Enhancing native selects with a better multi-select interface.
* Loading data from JavaScript: easily load items via ajax and have them
  searchable.
* Nesting optgroups: native selects only support one level of nested. Select2
  does not have this restriction.
* Tagging: ability to add new items on the fly.
* Working with large, remote datasets: ability to partially load a dataset
  based on the search term.
* Paging of large datasets: easy support for loading more pages when the
  results are scrolled to the end.
* Templating: support for custom rendering of results and selections.
